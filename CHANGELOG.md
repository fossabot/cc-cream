## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **The plugin status line no longer resolves its version with a shell glob.** The wired command was `ls … | grep -E … | sort -V | tail -1` over the plugin cache, run on every render — it depended on GNU `sort -V` (not guaranteed in the status-line subprocess, notably on macOS) and reverse-engineered Claude Code's undocumented cache layout. `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` doesn't expand in the status-line command context, so the command can't discover the current version itself. Instead the command now bakes the current version's **absolute** `cc-cream.js` path, and the `SessionStart` hook — which *does* receive `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` — re-pins it after a `/plugin update`. Both install modes now share one command shape (`[ -f "<entrypoint>" ] || exit 0; exec "<node>" "<entrypoint>"`); the `[ -f … ]` guard preserves the silent exit-0 when the plugin cache is deleted out from under a stale line.

### Internal
- **Settings.json read/parse/atomic-write logic is shared** between the installer and the `SessionStart` hook via a new `src/settings.js`, instead of a copy in each.

## [0.1.18] — 2026-05-29

### Security
- **Status-line text is now stripped of terminal control characters before output.** Three stdin-derived fields — `model.display_name`, `session_name`, and `effort.level` — were written to the terminal verbatim on every render. Because `session_name` can be derived from conversation content (which may include untrusted material), an embedded ANSI/OSC escape sequence would have been interpreted by the terminal (window-title/clipboard rewrites via OSC, or cursor/erase sequences that spoof or hide output). `paint()` now passes every segment through a `sanitize()` pass that drops C0/C1 control bytes (incl. ESC, BEL, DEL) while preserving the tool's own color codes, which are added afterward. The bar is purely visual, so the strip is lossless.
- **A crafted `session_id` can no longer corrupt the session-state map.** `session_id` is used as an object key; values of `__proto__`/`constructor`/`prototype` are now rejected in `getSessionState`/`patchSessionState`, and reads use `Object.hasOwn`.

### Fixed
- **Writes to `settings.json` (and the state file) are now atomic.** `install.js`, the `SessionStart` auto-setup hook, and `state.js` wrote via a direct `writeFileSync` over the live file; an interruption (crash, `ENOSPC`) mid-write could truncate `settings.json` and erase the user's permissions/hooks/plugins/MCP config — the very loss `readSettings` works to avoid. They now write a sibling temp file and `rename` it over the target (atomic within a filesystem; the temp shares the target's directory so the rename never crosses devices).
- **The plugin auto-update command now quotes the node binary path** (`exec "${nodePath}"`), so a node path containing spaces no longer breaks the status line.

### Changed
- **The session-state map is capped at 50 entries**, evicting the least-recently-touched sessions. It previously gained one key per `session_id` and was never pruned, growing without bound.

## [0.1.17] — 2026-05-29

### Fixed
- **`cc-cream-setup` and the `/cc-cream:*` slash commands silently did nothing when `~/.claude` is a symlink.** `install.js` had the same symlink-fragile entrypoint guard fixed in the renderer for 0.1.16 (`import.meta.url` is canonicalized by Node's ESM loader; `process.argv[1]` is not), so running it from a symlinked path skipped `main()` entirely — exit 0, no output, settings.json untouched. The "am-I-the-entrypoint?" check is now a single symlink-robust helper (`isEntrypoint` in `src/utils.js`) shared by both `cc-cream.js` and `install.js`. Caught by the new install-journey smoke tests.

### Added
- **End-to-end install/uninstall journey smoke tests** (`features/27-install-journey.feature`, CREAM-fxsusmgd). They stage a real plugin cache the way `/plugin install` lays it out, run the actual `SessionStart` hook and `install.js` as child processes, and execute the baked statusLine command through `sh -c` exactly as Claude Code does — guarding the *seams* unit specs can't: cache layout, the settings.json lifecycle, command order, the empty-cache guard (0.1.15), and symlinked config dirs (0.1.16). CI-safe; no live `claude` CLI needed.

## [0.1.16] — 2026-05-29

### Fixed
- **The status bar silently rendered nothing when `~/.claude` is a symlink** (dotfile managers like stow/chezmoi/yadm, or an iCloud/Dropbox-synced config dir). The "am-I-the-entrypoint" guard compared `import.meta.url` (which Node's ESM loader canonicalizes — symlinks resolved) against `pathToFileURL(process.argv[1])` (left as-invoked, through the symlink). Under a symlinked path the two never matched, so `main()` never ran and the bar appeared as an empty line with no error — invisible to diagnose. The guard now compares **realpaths** (falling back to the href check if realpath fails), so a symlinked install renders correctly. Found while verifying a fresh v0.1.15 plugin install.

## [0.1.15] — 2026-05-29

### Fixed
- **An orphaned status line no longer crashes on every render after `/plugin uninstall`.** If you ran `/plugin uninstall cc-cream` without first running `/cc-cream:uninstall`, the `statusLine` entry stayed in `settings.json` while the plugin cache was deleted. The cache-glob then matched nothing, the baked command collapsed to a bare relative `src/cc-cream.js`, and Claude Code hit `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` (exit 1) on every render — and `/cc-cream:uninstall` was gone, so the only fix was hand-editing `settings.json`. The auto-update command now captures the resolved version dir in `$d` and short-circuits with `[ -z "$d" ] && exit 0`, so an orphaned status line is inert (silent, exit 0) instead of a recurring error. "Degrade, never crash." New installs/auto-wires get the guarded command; existing users pick it up on their next `/cc-cream:setup`.

## [0.1.14] — 2026-05-29

### Changed
- **The status bar now turns itself on — no manual `/cc-cream:setup` for fresh installs** (CREAM-nywsljfq). Claude Code can't let a plugin contribute the main status line natively (only `agent`/`subagentStatusLine` are plugin-settable — verified by probe), so the bar still needs a write to `settings.json`. Instead of making you run `/cc-cream:setup`, the `SessionStart` hook (`hooks/auto-setup.js`, renamed from `setup-reminder.js`) now **auto-wires** cc-cream's `statusLine` on the first session after install — but **only when no status line is configured**. It never clobbers a status line you set for something else (that still routes through the interactive `/cc-cream:setup`), and a one-shot marker means it never re-adds the bar after you remove it with `/cc-cream:uninstall`. The nudge to run `/cc-cream:setup` now appears only in the foreign-status-line case. Output stays a single `systemMessage` (zero model tokens). You may need to restart/trust the workspace for the bar to appear.

## [0.1.13] — 2026-05-29

### Fixed
- **Setup/uninstall commands showed no visible feedback** (regression from 0.1.12). Trimming the command `.md` bodies to just the bang line removed the only part Claude Code surfaces prominently — a slash command's bang (`` !`…` ``) output is folded into the model prompt, not shown to the user — so running `/cc-cream:setup` appeared to do nothing. Restored a brief one-line note to each command body (visible confirmation of what's happening), while keeping the expensive statusLine-JSON echo out of `install.js` (the real token win from 0.1.12). Net: still far cheaper than ≤0.1.11, but the command no longer looks silent.

## [0.1.12] — 2026-05-29

### Changed
- **`/cc-cream:setup` and `/cc-cream:uninstall` are much cheaper to run** (CREAM-qhgyiodh). These are slash commands, so their `.md` body and the installer's stdout both enter the model context (~1k tokens for an uninstall). Trimmed the command bodies to just the bang line — the only essential human hint (“run `/plugin uninstall cc-cream` afterwards”) now lives in the frontmatter `description`, which is menu metadata rather than model-facing body. And `install.js` no longer echoes the full statusLine command JSON: it prints terse confirmations (`Removed cc-cream's statusLine.`, `Setting the cc-cream statusLine.`). The terse summary also survives Claude Code's command-output fold, so the “what was removed / kept” feedback is actually visible. (The bar itself remains zero-token — it's never in the model context; this only concerns the occasional setup/uninstall commands.)

## [0.1.11] — 2026-05-29

### Fixed
- **Status bar could pin to an old version when a non-semver cache dir exists** (CREAM-kxwhbwzq). The plugin-mode statusLine self-resolves the highest installed version with `ls -1d …/cc-cream/*/ | sort -V | tail -1`. `sort -V` sorts directory *names*, so a git-sha install dir (e.g. `c83650b6360f/`) sorts after every `0.1.x` and got picked — pinning the bar to whatever version that dir held (observed: 0.1.3), with `/plugin update` unable to move off it. The command now filters to semver-named dirs (`grep -E '/[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)+/$'`) before `sort -V`, so a stray non-numeric dir can't hijack version selection. Re-run `/cc-cream:setup` once (or reinstall) to rewrite the statusLine with the hardened command.

## [0.1.10] — 2026-05-29

### Added
- **Setup reminder after plugin install** (CREAM-cpcwjkxi). Installing the plugin makes the commands available but can't wire the status bar (Claude Code has no install hook to write `settings.json`), so users saw no bar and didn't know to run `/cc-cream:setup`. A `SessionStart` hook (`hooks/hooks.json`, auto-discovered) now emits a one-line `systemMessage` nudging the user to run `/cc-cream:setup` — but **only while cc-cream's statusLine is absent**, so it self-silences once setup runs. `systemMessage` is shown to the user and adds **nothing** to the model context (zero tokens). Degrades safely: missing `settings.json` → nudge; malformed → silent; always exits 0. Biome now also lints `hooks/`.

## [0.1.9] — 2026-05-29

### Fixed
- **`/cc-cream:setup` and `/cc-cream:uninstall` no longer hang on a y/N prompt** (CREAM-vxbbrypj). The slash commands run `install.js` via Claude Code's bang execution, which has no interactive TTY, so install.js's readline prompts blocked forever — the uninstaller's "delete runtime/state?" prompt was the dead end. install.js now detects a missing TTY and resolves prompts non-interactively: uninstall removes the `statusLine` and **keeps** the runtime/state artifacts (re-run in a terminal or pass `--purge` to delete them); setup overwrites an existing *cc-cream* `statusLine` but never clobbers a foreign one without a terminal or the new `--force`/`--yes` flag. Interactive terminals are unchanged. (Plugin removal still takes two steps — `/cc-cream:uninstall` then `/plugin uninstall cc-cream` — because Claude Code has no plugin-uninstall hook to clean `settings.json` automatically.)

## [0.1.8] — 2026-05-29

### Added
- **`cc-cream-setup` bin for npm users** (CREAM-gvrvnhsc). `npm install -g cc-cream` now exposes a first-class `cc-cream-setup` command (and `cc-cream-setup --uninstall` / `--purge`) that runs the consent installer, replacing the clunky `node $(npm root -g)/cc-cream/src/install.js`. The existing `cc-cream` bin remains the status-line renderer.
- **CI workflow that runs the publish gate on a CLI-less runner** (CREAM-xzhidmjt). `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `npm test` — the exact command `prepublishOnly` runs — on every PR and push to `main`, and asserts the `claude` CLI is absent so it mirrors the npm-publish environment.

### Changed
- **Publish gate is now CI-safe by construction** (CREAM-xzhidmjt). Scenarios that shell out to a live `claude` are tagged `@needs-cli` and excluded from the default cucumber profile (`not @manual and not @needs-cli`); run them with `npm run test:cli`. Previously such a scenario could go `pending` on a runner without the CLI and silently break `npm publish` — now any regression of that kind fails on the PR instead.

## [0.1.7] — 2026-05-29

### Fixed
- **Marketplace install failed with `commands: Invalid input`** (regression from 0.1.6). The install-time manifest schema rejects a `commands` array of file paths in `plugin.json`, even though `claude plugin validate` (which is more lenient) accepts it — so the 0.1.6 "fix" passed local validation but still broke real installs. Removed the `commands` key entirely and moved the command files back to a top-level `commands/` directory (plugin root), letting Claude Code auto-discover them. This matches the official `ralph-loop` plugin layout. Verified end-to-end with a real `claude plugin install` from a local marketplace.

## [0.1.6] — 2026-05-29

### Fixed
- **Plugin commands still not appearing after installation.** The validator resolves `commands` paths in `plugin.json` relative to `.claude-plugin/`, and also requires the file to exist at that path. Moved command files from `commands/` (repo root) to `.claude-plugin/commands/`, so `./commands/setup.md` now correctly resolves to `.claude-plugin/commands/setup.md`. `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` in the command bodies is unaffected — it always points to the plugin root.

## [0.1.5] — 2026-05-29

### Fixed
- **TTL falsely resets after non-API Claude Code events** (e.g. `/plugin update`). The TTL anchor was the `mtime` of the transcript file, which updates whenever Claude Code writes any event to the transcript — not just API turns. The anchor is now derived from session state: when `total_input_tokens` grows between renders (indicating a real API turn), `last_api_ts` is stored and used as the anchor on subsequent renders. Falls back to transcript mtime only on the first render before any state exists.
- **Plugin command paths fixed for real** (reverts the `../` change from 0.1.3). The Claude Code plugin validator rejects `..` path traversal; command paths in `plugin.json` resolve from the plugin root, not from `.claude-plugin/`, so `./commands/setup.md` is correct.

## [0.1.4] — 2026-05-29

### Fixed
- **Node DEP0190 deprecation warning during setup.** `resolveNodePath()` called `execFileSync('command', ['-v', 'node'], { shell: true })`, which Node warns about because args are concatenated rather than escaped when `shell` is true. Switched to `execSync('command -v node')` — no behavior change, warning gone.

## [0.1.3] — 2026-05-29

### Fixed
- **Plugin commands not registered.** `plugin.json` listed command paths as `./commands/setup.md` (relative to `.claude-plugin/`), which Claude Code cannot resolve. Changed to `../commands/setup.md` so the paths correctly point to the `commands/` directory at the repo root.

## [0.1.2] — 2026-05-29

### Changed
- **No install-time lifecycle scripts in the published package.** The git-hook
  registration moved off the `prepare` lifecycle to an opt-in `npm run hooks`,
  so `npm install`/`npx cc-cream` runs nothing automatically. Improves the
  supply-chain posture (and Socket score) with no change to the runtime.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-05-29

### Added
- **Uninstall** — `node src/install.js --uninstall` (and the `/cc-cream:uninstall`
  plugin command) removes cc-cream's `statusLine` block, but only when it is
  cc-cream's; a foreign statusLine is left untouched. Offers to delete the copied
  runtime and session-state files, and keeps `~/.claude/cc-cream.json` unless
  `--purge` is passed.

### Fixed
- **Never overwrite a malformed `settings.json`** — the installer now refuses to
  write when `settings.json` exists but fails to parse (or is not a JSON object),
  instead of silently starting fresh and erasing the user's other settings.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-29

Initial public release. cc-cream reads the JSON Claude Code pipes to its status
line and prints a colored ≤3-row bar — zero tokens, the model never sees it.

### Added
- **Status-line engine** — fourteen configurable segments across up to three
  rows: `ctx`, `cache`, `write`, `ttl`, `effort`, `thinking`, `api_ratio`,
  `cost` (row 1); `5h`, `7d`, `burn`, `peak` (row 2, hidden for API users);
  `model`, `session_name` (row 3). Node built-ins only, no runtime dependencies.
- **Per-session state** keyed by `session_id` for burn-rate projection, cost
  delta on `/clear`, and cache-drop detection.
- **Configuration** via `~/.claude/cc-cream.json` — every display decision
  (on/off, row, order, thresholds, colors) is data-driven, with per-field and
  whole-file fallback. Degrades gracefully: malformed input never crashes.
- **Distribution as a Claude Code plugin** — `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and a
  self-hosted `marketplace.json`. Install with
  `/plugin marketplace add bart-turczynski/cc-cream` then `/plugin install cc-cream`.
- **`/cc-cream:setup` command** that wires the status line into `settings.json`
  with a self-resolving cache-glob command, so `/plugin update` applies new
  versions automatically with no network calls and no re-run of setup.
- **npm distribution** — `cc-cream` bin with a node shebang; installable via
  `npx -y cc-cream@latest`.
- **Consent-based installer** (`src/install.js`) for the manual / GitHub path:
  copies the runtime into `~/.claude/cc-cream` and writes one `statusLine` block,
  preserving any existing configuration and asking before replacing it.
- **Docs & trust** — user-facing README, `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and a
  prominent disclosure: no network calls, no telemetry, no runtime dependencies.

### Notes
- Supports **macOS and Linux**; Windows is a planned fast-follow.
- Requires Claude Code **2.1.132+** (`effort` / `thinking` need 2.1.145+).
