**C.R.E.A.M. — Cache Rules Everything Around Me.**

A lightweight status-line tool for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
that turns the JSON Claude Code pipes to its status line into a glanceable,
colored ≤3-row bar. The model **never sees the output** — it costs **zero tokens**.

## What it shows

```
ctx:3% [30k] | cache:55% | ~$0.10
5h:22% ↺ 0m | 7d:36% ↺ Sat 21:00
Opus 4.7 (1M context) | example session
```

> Rendered from a live Claude Code subscriber session (fixtures/subscriber.golden.json).
> A proper screenshot or asciinema recording will appear here after public release.

- **Row 1** — this session: context-window occupancy, cache hit rate, session cost
- **Row 2** — rate-limit budget windows: 5h and 7d usage + reset countdown (subscribers only; API users get one row)
- **Row 3** — identity: model name and optional session name

The bar helps you avoid rate limits, keep the cache warm, and catch context fill
before the model degrades — with cache economics as the organizing story.

## Trust and data posture

- **No network calls.** The engine is a pure stdin → stdout transformer. It never
  opens a socket, fetches a URL, or calls home.
- **No telemetry.** Nothing is collected, reported, or logged anywhere.
- **No runtime dependencies.** Node built-ins only. `npm install` is for dev tools
  (Cucumber, Biome) — nothing that runs at render time.
- **Zero tokens.** Claude Code reads the bar output to display it; the model never
  receives it.

The only I/O is reading the JSON blob Claude Code pipes on stdin and writing one
session-state file to `~/.claude/cc-cream-state.json` (keyed by session ID,
contains cost and rate-limit samples used for the burn projection).

## Requirements

- **Node.js** — already present; Claude Code is a Node app.
- **Claude Code ≥ 2.1.132** (released 2026-05-06). The cache figure requires
  `context_window.current_usage`, which landed in that release.
- The `effort` and `thinking` segments additionally require **Claude Code ≥ 2.1.145**;
  they stay hidden below that version.

## Platform support

v1 supports **macOS and Linux**. Windows support is a planned fast-follow; the
engine is pure Node and the only blocker is the statusLine shell-command wiring.

## Install

### Option 1 — Claude Code plugin (community catalog / self-hosted marketplace)

If cc-cream is listed in the community catalog:
```bash
/plugin install cc-cream
```

To use the self-hosted marketplace directly:
```bash
/plugin marketplace add bart-turczynski/cc-cream
/plugin install cc-cream
```

That's usually all you need: on the first session after install, cc-cream
**auto-wires** its `statusLine` into `~/.claude/settings.json` (you may need to
restart or trust the workspace for the bar to appear). It only does this when no
status line is configured — it never overwrites one you set for something else,
and it never re-adds the bar after you remove it.

If you already have a status line and want to replace it with cc-cream's, run:
```
/cc-cream:setup
```

The `/cc-cream:setup` command runs the consent installer, which writes the
`statusLine` block to `~/.claude/settings.json`. Updates are automatic: when
`/plugin update` drops a new version into the cache, the next render picks it up
without any further action.

### Option 2 — npm

```bash
npm install -g cc-cream
```

Then wire it into Claude Code with the bundled CLI:
```bash
cc-cream-setup
```

`cc-cream-setup` runs the consent installer (`src/install.js`). Without a global
install you can run it through npx:
```bash
npx -y -p cc-cream cc-cream-setup
```

### Option 3 — Manual GitHub clone

Download and install by cloning the repository, then run the consent installer:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bart-turczynski/cc-cream.git
node cc-cream/src/install.js
```

The installer:
- Detects an existing `statusLine` and **asks before replacing it**
- **Preserves any `padding`** you have set
- Is **idempotent** — re-running when cc-cream is already installed changes nothing
- States the trust and restart requirement

After install, Claude Code must be **trusted** for the directory (if prompted),
and you may need to **restart** it for the bar to appear.

> **Pick one install method.** If you wire cc-cream via npm/manual (Options 2–3)
> and *then* install the plugin, the plugin won't take over the existing wiring —
> it points at your home copy, so `/plugin update` won't auto-update the bar. To
> switch to the auto-updating plugin, run `/cc-cream:setup` (or `cc-cream-setup
> --uninstall` first). Nothing breaks either way; it just stays on whichever
> method wired it.

### Uninstall

Plugin users — two steps, **in this order** (Claude Code can't clean
`settings.json` when a plugin is removed, so the wiring is cleared separately
from the cache):
```
/cc-cream:uninstall          # 1. removes the statusLine wiring (run this FIRST)
/plugin uninstall cc-cream   # 2. drops the plugin
```
`/cc-cream:uninstall` also auto-cleans cc-cream's regenerable scratch (the copied
runtime and session-state file); add `--purge` (`/cc-cream:uninstall --purge`) to
also delete your `~/.claude/cc-cream.json` config. The bar disappears on your next
message — restart an already-open session to drop it immediately.

> **Order matters — but you're covered if you get it wrong.** `/cc-cream:uninstall`
> lives inside the plugin, so once you run `/plugin uninstall` it's gone. Neither
> host command clears the `statusLine` block *or* the version cache. The renderer
> notices when it's running from a cache the host no longer lists as installed and
> **self-suppresses**, so the bar stops on the next session even though the inert
> `statusLine` line still lingers in `settings.json`.
>
> To clear that leftover line once the plugin is gone, the **guaranteed** route is
> the copy of the uninstaller still in the cache — npm-free and always present:
> ```bash
> node ~/.claude/plugins/cache/cc-cream/cc-cream/<version>/src/install.js --uninstall
> # add --purge to also remove your config
> ```
> The npm bin does the same job, but **not always**: a *freshly published* version
> is blocked by npm's min-package-age safe-chain guard (it reports "command not
> found") until it ages in, so use it only if the cache route isn't handy:
> ```bash
> npx -y -p cc-cream cc-cream-setup --uninstall
> ```
> You can always remove the `statusLine` key from `~/.claude/settings.json` by hand.

npm / manual users:
```bash
cc-cream-setup --uninstall                 # npm (add --purge to also remove the config)
node cc-cream/src/install.js --uninstall   # manual clone
```

Uninstall removes the `statusLine` block **only if it is cc-cream's** — a
statusLine you wired for something else is left untouched. It always cleans the
regenerable scratch (the copied runtime and session state, both recreated on a
reinstall); `--purge` additionally removes your `~/.claude/cc-cream.json` config.
The bar clears on your next message (restart an already-open session to drop it now).

Likewise, `cc-cream-setup` run non-interactively will overwrite an existing
*cc-cream* statusLine but never a foreign one — pass `--force` to replace
regardless.

## Configuration

Every display decision is read from `~/.claude/cc-cream.json`. Edit it by hand
or ask Claude to. It is strict JSON with no comments. **Every field falls back to
its built-in default if missing or malformed** — a typo degrades one value rather
than breaking the bar; a whole-file parse error falls back to all defaults.

Because unknown or out-of-range fields are silently ignored, run the doctor after
editing by hand to catch typos:

```bash
cc-cream-setup --check-config   # reports unknown keys / out-of-domain values; exits non-zero if any
```

```json
{
  "numbers": "compact",
  "ttl": "auto",
  "percentage": "consumed",
  "segments": {
    "ctx":          { "on": true,  "row": 1, "order": 2, "amber": 30, "orange": 40, "red": 50, "basis": "window", "ceiling": 200000, "display": "basis" },
    "cache":        { "on": true,  "row": 1, "order": 3 },
    "write":        { "on": false, "row": 1, "order": 3.5 },
    "ttl":          { "on": true,  "row": 1, "order": 4, "amber": 50, "red": 80 },
    "cost":         { "on": true,  "row": 1, "order": 5 },
    "effort":       { "on": false, "row": 1, "order": 6 },
    "thinking":     { "on": false, "row": 1, "order": 7 },
    "api_ratio":    { "on": false, "row": 1, "order": 8 },
    "5h":           { "on": true,  "row": 2, "order": 1, "amber": 75, "red": 90 },
    "burn":         { "on": true,  "row": 2, "order": 1.5 },
    "7d":           { "on": true,  "row": 2, "order": 2, "amber": 75, "red": 90 },
    "peak":         { "on": true,  "row": 2, "order": 3, "start": 5, "end": 11 },
    "model":        { "on": true,  "row": 3, "order": 0.5 },
    "session_name": { "on": false, "row": 3, "order": 1 }
  }
}
```

### Global keys

- `numbers`: `compact` (e.g. `38k`) or `exact` (`38000`) for token magnitudes.
- `ttl`: cache time-to-live used to color the `ttl` segment — `auto` (recommended),
  `60`, or `5` minutes. `auto` infers from rate-limit data when available.
- `percentage`: `consumed` (default) counts up — `ctx:19%` means 19% of the window
  is used, `5h:67%` means 67% of the 5h budget is gone. `remaining` flips the
  budget/occupancy segments to count down (`ctx:81%`, `5h:33%`). Only `ctx`, `5h`
  and `7d` flip; `cache%` (a hit-rate, not a budget) and `ttl` (a countdown) are
  unaffected. **Thresholds are always expressed in consumed terms regardless of
  this setting.**

### Per-segment keys

Every segment accepts:
- `on` (boolean) — whether to show the segment
- `row` (1, 2, or 3) — which row to place it on
- `order` (any number) — lower = further left within the row

Colored segments additionally accept threshold keys. Thresholds mark the
**lower bound** where that color begins.

### Segment catalog

| Segment | Default | Example | Meaning | Color |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ctx` | on, row 1 | `ctx:19% [38k]` | context-window occupancy + input-token magnitude | `<30` green · `30–40` amber · `40–50` orange · `≥50` red |
| `cache` | on, row 1 | `cache:95%` | last-turn cache hit rate (reads / total tokens) | neutral |
| `write` | **off**, row 1 | `write:4%` | last-turn cache creation rate (new writes / total tokens) | neutral |
| `ttl` | on, row 1 | `ttl:00:52` | time remaining before cache expires (counts down to 00:00) | `<50%` green · `50–80%` amber · `≥80%` red |
| `cost` | on, row 1 | `~$4.50` | session cost incl. subagents; `~` = CC's estimate | neutral; hidden when zero |
| `effort` | **off**, row 1 | `effort:high` | reasoning effort level (requires CC ≥ 2.1.145) | neutral |
| `thinking` | **off**, row 1 | `think:on` | thinking mode indicator (requires CC ≥ 2.1.145) | neutral |
| `api_ratio` | **off**, row 1 | `∿ api:74%` | fraction of wall time spent on API calls | neutral |
| `5h` | on, row 2 | `5h:23% ↺ 2h14m` | 5-hour rate-limit window + reset countdown | `≥75` amber · `≥90` red |
| `burn` | on, row 2 | `~38m` | estimated minutes until 5h cap at current pace | neutral; hidden when ETA > 5h or no prior sample |
| `7d` | on, row 2 | `7d:41% ↺ 4d` | weekly rate-limit window + reset countdown | same as 5h |
| `peak` | on, row 2 | `peak` | weekday Pacific-time window where 5h drains faster | amber; hidden outside window |
| `model` | on, row 3 | `Sonnet 4.6` | current model name | none |
| `session_name` | **off**, row 3 | `My project session` | conversation name from CC | none |

Any segment hides cleanly when its source field is absent — API users have no
`rate_limits`; `current_usage` is null right after `/compact`; etc.

Row 2 is hidden entirely for API users (no `rate_limits` in stdin).
Row 3 suppresses itself when all its segments are hidden.

### Row 1 layout

Row 1 has two zones separated by ` | `:

```
[ctx · cache · write · ttl · effort · thinking · api_ratio] | [cost]
```

Segments within zone 1 are also separated by ` | `. Segments moved off their
default row via config must land in a zone to appear on row 1.

### `ctx`-specific keys

- `basis`: `window` (default) colors based on `used_percentage` of the real context
  window. `ceiling` colors based on `total_input_tokens / ceiling`, so the warning
  fires at the same absolute token count on any window size. On a 1M-context model
  the window basis stays green well past where quality degrades — set `ceiling` if
  you want an early warning that doesn't scale with the window.
- `ceiling`: token count the `ceiling` basis measures against. Default `200000`.
- `display`: with `basis: "ceiling"`, `basis` (default) shows the % toward the
  ceiling so number and color agree; `window` pins it to CC's window figure but
  still colors by the ceiling. No effect under `basis: "window"`.

### `ctx` thresholds

Default: `amber: 30`, `orange: 40`, `red: 50` (percent consumed).

### `ttl` thresholds

Default: `amber: 50`, `red: 80` (percent of the resolved TTL consumed).

### `5h` / `7d` thresholds

Default: `amber: 75`, `red: 90` (absolute `used_percentage`).

### `peak`-specific keys

- `start` / `end`: hours in Pacific time (0–23, exclusive end) bounding
  Anthropic's faster-drain window. Defaults `5`–`11`. Weekday-only (Mon–Fri) and
  the `America/Los_Angeles` timezone are hardcoded policy facts, not config.

## Troubleshooting

cc-cream is built to degrade silently — if a stdin field is missing or malformed
it just hides that segment rather than crashing. When the bar is unexpectedly
empty or shorter than you expect, turn on diagnostics:

```bash
export CC_CREAM_DEBUG=1   # then trigger a render in Claude Code
```

Each render appends a line to `~/.claude/cc-cream-debug.log` (override the path
with `CC_CREAM_DEBUG_LOG`) listing which segments rendered, which were dropped,
the resolved TTL window, and the stdin size. It never writes to the status line
itself, so it costs zero tokens. Unset the variable to turn it off.

## Development

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to run the tests. The runtime
uses only Node built-ins — no runtime dependencies.
